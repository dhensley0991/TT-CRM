Nicholas M. (Wed, 7/14/2021, 12:51:01 pm)
Ramtin, the shares get taken earlier in the morning if you want to try to secure them earlier. I will forward this over to the team. What broker are you referring to that had locates?

Ramtin Goodarzi (Wed, 7/14/2021, 12:52:05 pm)

Ramtin Goodarzi (Wed, 7/14/2021, 12:58:56 pm)
Doing well. More and more everyday the locates seem to be gone quick or just have no shares available all day

Ramtin Goodarzi (Wed, 7/14/2021, 12:59:09 pm)

Ramtin Goodarzi (Wed, 7/14/2021, 12:59:26 pm)
